# Notle

Notle is like Wordle, the word guessing game that took the world by storm in 2022. But, rather than trying to 
guess a 5 letter word, the player must guess a 5 note melody. The player can listen to the melody before each guess,
which is entered on a keyboard. After submitting their guess, the player will get feedback in the form of audio playback
and contextual colors that indicate which guessed notes are in the melody and if they are in the right position.
